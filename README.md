# web-quiz-wizard

## The challenge was to create a quiz that when you click the start button, a timer starts and you are presented with a question.  When you answer a question, you are presented with another question. When you answer incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over. When the game is over, you can save your initials and score.
